        Although Kant only explicitly distinguishes between acroams and axioms in L, the distinction is implied throughout his theoretical philosophy. Both are basic principles (Grundsätze), but axioms are exhibited in in­tuition while acroams are presented discursively (L p. 606). The reasonfor the distinction between the two sorts of basic principle is to be found
        in Kant's polemics against Wolff's extension of mathematical forms of proof to philosophy. In PE Kant distinguishes between the 'unanalysable principles' of mathematics and philosophy, regarding the former (axioms) as figural, the latter (acroams) as discursive. As opposed to mathematical axioms, philosophical principles 'are never anything other than words'
        (PE Part I, §2).

        In CPR the distinction between axioms and discursive principles is no longer immediately linguistic, but hangs on the condition of the temporal determination of experience. The acroams are the 12 principles of pure understanding (axioms of intuition, anticipations of perception, analogies
        of experience, postulates of empirical thought). These principles are not axiomatic, but discursive; they receive their authority through a discursive process of legitimation or proof. This proof is performed through the re-work.ing of traditional philosophical terms, such as, in the case of the first analogy, those of 'substance and accident'. The acroams are open to constant discursive challenge, and are legitimated through language
        and the analysis of language. Kant's insight into the linguistic character of philosophical principles was largely lost until the twentieth century and the emergence of interpretations informed by hermeneutic and analytical philosophies of language (see, e.g., Bennett, 1966, 1974; Gadamer, 1960;
        Heidegger, 1929; Strawson, 1966).
